# Kickstarting with Excel
## Overview of Project
Here, we will be visualizing the relationship between outcomes for fundraising campaigns for plays on Kickstarter and campaign launch date. We will also be visualizing the relationship between campaign outcome and campaign goals. Lastly, we will discuss the challenges faced when performing such analyses and the limitations of conclusions drawn.
### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to provide an analysis of fundraising campaigns for plays on Kickstarter and determine the relationship between campaign outcome and campaign launch date and funding goals, if any.
## Analysis and Challenges
- Explain how you performed your analysis using images and links to code, as well as any challenges you encountered and how you overcame them. If you had no challenges, describe any possible challenges or difficulties that could be encountered.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
To examine the relationship between campaign outcome and launch date, 
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
## Results
- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
